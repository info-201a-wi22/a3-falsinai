## Introduction 
  The United States has one of the highest incarceration rate in the world. The dataset _Incarceration trends_ provides up to date information about the trajectory 
  and scope of incarceration across the U.S.. This report focuses on the number of females in jail. I extracted data to determine which county has the highest average female
  jail population. Also, I extracted the year and state with the highest female jail population. Additionally, I used the dataset to find the total female jail population in Washington state and found the top five counties with the highest.
  To visualize some of my findings, I have created a _variable comparison chart_ that shows the female jail population compared to the male jail population, a _trend over time chart_, and a _map_.

## Trend over time 
 ```{r echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
 female_jail_pop_over_time_in_top_5
 ```
 The trend over time chart shows how the female jail population has changed over the course of the years in the top five counties. 
 
 ## Variable Coparison Chart
 ```{r echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
 variable_comparison_chart
 ```
 This chart compares the female jail population and the male jail population to see how incarceration varies based on gender. 
 
 ## Map
 ```{r echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
 female_jail_map
 ```
 The map displays the female jail population in different counties.
